# Farm Animal Health Care

I embarked on my quest to tackle real-world problems, I became captivated by the challenges that the farming industry confronts. 🌾 Despite its crucial role in sustaining human life, farming is plagued by a wide range of challenges, from environmental issues 🌍 to animal welfare concerns 🐄. These challenges motivated me to explore potential solutions that could have a tangible impact on the industry.

After delving into various solutions, I honed in on animal healthcare as my focus area. 🐾 One of the most significant obstacles that farmers encounter is the ability to keep track of the health of their animals. 🐑 With this in mind, I developed an application that enables farmers to track animal health in real-time.

The application I created operates similarly to a smartwatch health system, enabling farmers to monitor vital signs like pulse rate, heart rate, and other health-related features. 📈 Each animal is outfitted with a hardware device 📟 that can collect data on the animal's specific health metrics. This data is then fed into the application, which presents it in a user-friendly and easy-to-understand format. 📊

My primary goal for this project was to develop an intuitive and easy-to-use mobile application that simplifies the process of accessing and navigating animal health data for farmers. 📱 I recognised that farmers are often juggling multiple tasks, so I wanted to create an application that could save them time and streamline their daily operations. My hope is that this contribution will ultimately lead to the enhancement of animal welfare and the overall farming industry. 🚜🌱

I am confident that my passion for effecting change and my eagerness to contribute to the betterment of society will enable me to make a valuable contribution to any future employer. This project demonstrated my ability to identify complex problems and develop innovative solutions while showcasing my skills in user interface design and development. 🚀
